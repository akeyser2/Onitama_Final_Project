# CPSC 224 Final Project: Onitama

### Project Description:
For our Software Development final project, we designed a virtual re-creation of the strategic board game Onitama. This uses completely custom artwork for all of the sprites. This is a re-creation of the original game and does not include any of the expansions. To run the game, run the "GameMenu.java" file inside src\main\java\edu\gonzaga\BasicGUI  --  (working on creating an executable .jar file)
